## Introduction
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook to document the DWP sample selection process for Erb, Paddy, and Gilmour Creek. We are otolith separating all samples for Stockdale and Hogan Bay. The **goal** of this Notebook is to pick 8, full (all 48 samples) DWPs from each of the three streams in order to estimate the *stray* rate or *proportion hatchery in stream*. These DWPs will be tissue/otolith separated and sent to Cordova for otolith reading. All other DWPs from these three creeks will be dessicated for storage, but not tissue/otolith separated. 

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
```

## Import Data
Tray inventory data from Finsight's Hatchery-Wild database sent by Pete Rand on 10/4/18
```{r import_data, message=FALSE}
dwp <- read_csv(file = "../Inventory/2018 HW Tray Inventory as of 10.04.18 FINAL to ADFG.csv") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Region))
dwp
```

## Review Samples per Stream
Visualize number of otolith samples per stream.
```{r data_review, message=FALSE}
dwp %>% 
  group_by(`Stream Name`) %>% 
  summarise(n_otoliths = sum(`Num Otoliths`))
```

Need to create a new variable for stream since they specified tributaries. Will also format dates.
```{r data_manipulate}
level_key <- list("Erb C" = "Erb",
                  "Gilmour C" = "Gilmour",
                  "Gilmour Right Trib Below Lake" = "Gilmour",
                  "Hogan Bay" = "Hogan",
                  "Paddy C" = "Paddy",
                  "Paddy Left Trib" = "Paddy",
                  "Paddy Lower Right Trib" = "Paddy",
                  "Stockdale C" = "Stockdale",
                  "Stockdale Right Trib" = "Stockdale")

dwp <- dwp %>% 
  mutate(stream = recode(`Stream Name`, !!!level_key)) %>% 
  separate(`Sample Date`, into = c("date", "time", "AM/PM"), sep = " ") %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  rename(n_otoliths = `Num Otoliths`, dwp_barcode = `Sample Tray Id`) %>% 
  select(stream, date, n_otoliths, dwp_barcode) %>% 
  arrange(stream, date)

dwp %>% 
  group_by(stream) %>% 
  summarise(n_otoliths = sum(n_otoliths))
```

Plot number of samples per stream per day.
```{r plot_samples_stream}
dwp %>%
  group_by(stream, date) %>% 
  summarise(n_otoliths = sum(n_otoliths)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n_otoliths)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(stream ~ .)
```

Note that the every other day sampling patterns are because one crew was sampling Erb/Paddy and another was sampling Gilmour/Stockdale. Hogan had it's own, dedicated sampling crew.

## Sample Selection
Now pick DWPs systematically. First determine number of DWPs per stream.
```{r dwp_stream}
dwp %>% 
  count(stream)
```

Select Erb samples
```{r select_erb}
dwp_erb <- dwp %>% 
  filter(stream == "Erb") %>% 
  slice(seq(from = n()/8/2 - 2, by = n()/8, length.out = 8))
dwp_erb
```

Select Paddy samples
```{r select_paddy}
dwp_paddy <- dwp %>% 
  filter(stream == "Paddy") %>% 
  slice(seq(from = n()/8/2 + 2, by = n()/8, length.out = 8))
dwp_paddy
```

Select Gilmour samples
```{r select_gilmour}
dwp_gilmour <- dwp %>% 
  filter(stream == "Gilmour") %>% 
  slice(seq(from = n()/8/2 - 1, by = n()/8, length.out = 8))
dwp_gilmour
```

## Write Out Selection
```{r write_selection}
bind_rows(dwp_erb, dwp_paddy, dwp_gilmour) %>% 
  write_csv(path = "../Otolith Separation/PWS_pink_otolith_separation_2018.csv")
```

Fin!
